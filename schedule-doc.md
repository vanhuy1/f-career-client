## API Endpoints

### Company-Scoped Endpoints

```typescript
POST   /companies/:companyId/events     // Create event
GET    /companies/:companyId/events     // List company events
```

### Event Management

```typescript
GET    /events/:eventId                 // Get event details
PATCH  /events/:eventId                 // Update event
DELETE /events/:eventId                 // Cancel/delete event
POST   /events/:eventId/reschedule      // Reschedule event
```

### Participant Actions

```typescript
POST   /events/:eventId/confirm         // Confirm attendance
POST   /events/:eventId/decline         // Decline attendance
```

### User-Scoped Endpoints

```typescript
GET    /users/me/events                 // Get current user's events
GET    /users/:userId/upcoming          // Get upcoming events
POST   /users/:userId/conflicts         // Check time conflicts
```

## Database Schema

### Tables Created

- `schedule_events` - Main event table
- `schedule_participants` - Participant junction table

### Indexes for Performance

- Time-based queries optimization
- Company and user scoped lookups
- Active events partial index
- Time range conflict detection (GIST index)

### Database Enums

- `event_type_enum` (interview, meeting)
- `event_status_enum` (pending, confirmed, cancelled)
- `participant_role_enum` (candidate, interviewer, attendee, host)
- `response_status_enum` (pending, accepted, declined)

## Integration Points

### ✅ Existing System Integration

- **User Management**: Integrated with existing User entity
- **Company Management**: Integrated with existing Company entity
- **Authentication**: Uses existing JWT authentication
- **Authorization**: Extends existing ACL system
- **Logging**: Uses existing AppLogger service
- **Events**: Uses existing EventEmitter service
- **Email**: Uses existing MailService

### ✅ Shared Services

- `SharedModule` integration
- `AppLogger` for structured logging
- `EventEmitterService` for domain events
- `MailService` for email notifications

## Deployment Requirements

### ✅ Database Migration

## Error Handling

### HTTP Status Codes

- `400 Bad Request` - Invalid input data
- `401 Unauthorized` - Missing authentication
- `403 Forbidden` - Insufficient permissions
- `404 Not Found` - Resource not found
- `409 Conflict` - Time conflicts or version mismatches
- `422 Unprocessable Entity` - Validation errors

### Error Response Format

  statusCode: number;
  message: string;
  error: string;
  details?: Array<{field: string, message: string}>;
  timestamp: string;
  path: string;
}
```

| LIST   | Own events only | Company events | All events |
| READ   | Own events only | Company events | All events |
| CREATE | ❌              | Company events | All events |
| UPDATE | Response only   | Company events | All events |
| DELETE | ❌              | Company events | All events |
